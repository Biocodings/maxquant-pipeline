# Running MaxQuant

This document shows how to manually run a small analysis job using MaxQuant.

### Preparing the data

Running a MaxQuant job requires mass spectrometry data in *.mzXML format. In this example we'll be conducting an analysis on two files:

* JK042415_042415_RadOnc_01_10Gy_SS_BRP_IMAC_F01.mzXML
* JK042415_042415_RadOnc_01_10Gy_SS_BRP_IMAC_F02.mzXML

In addition to the mzXML files, you'll also need a FASTA formatted sequence file. In this example we'll use the following sequence file:

* uniprot_taxonomy_9606_Reviewed.fasta

After you have the mass spec data (mzXML) and the sequence file (FASTA) that you want to use you are ready to start MaxQuant and configure your analysis.
